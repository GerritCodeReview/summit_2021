# Gerrit Virtual User Summit 2021

## The Gerrit Community gets together

The Gerrit Community is happy to announce the Gerrit Virtual User Summit 2021,
THE event of the year for everything related to Gerrit Code Review and the
trunk-based development pipeline.

## A Virtual Summit

The Gerrit Virtual User Summit & Hackathon 2021 will be held online only,
to allow most of the community around the globe to attend and share their
experience and ideas, and avoid the problems with the travelling restrictions
due to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19).

The 2-days Users Summit is open to all the members of the community as well as
those that are willing to learn and adopt Gerrit Code Review in their
development process.
