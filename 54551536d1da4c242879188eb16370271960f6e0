      "message": "Replication is definitely an issue for us, when dealing with large mono repos. We for example faced issues with replication delays of 2+ hours, when replication and git gc happened at the same time, which we could solve by not computing the bitmap indexes, which is a tradeoff. For another repository we weren\u0027t able to get replication to work with a reasonable replication delay at all, so that we can\u0027t use Gerrit replicas on different machines.",
