# Using GitHub Actions with GerritHub

In this session we demonstrate how the [CUE](https://cuelang.org/) project uses
GerritHub in combination with GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and
regression testing. Following a live demo, we explain the overall architecture
of the setup, introduce the open source command line tooling that drives the
process, and show how we use CUE to manage our GitHub Actions workflow
configurations instead of Yaml.
