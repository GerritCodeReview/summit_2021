# XRAY for Gerrit in AWS

Here at GerritForge we are doubling down the efforts to bring Gerrit to the
cloud. As part of this endeavour, we have been working on the AWS-Gerrit
project, which strives to provide a framework to seamlessly deploying and
maintaining gerrit installations in AWS.

This short live demo will focus on one of our recent addition: the integration
with [AWS X-RAY](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/). X-Ray helps to understand how
Gerrit and related services are performing to identify and troubleshoot the root
cause of performance issues and errors.
