# Qualcomm 2.7 -> 3.4+ Data Upgrade Status, Issues, and Plans

Qualcomm [has been working on](https://groups.google.com/g/repo-discuss/c/WVwvngCkRMs/)
improving the performance of all the migration steps required to
upgrade a very large Gerrit site from a 2.7 fork to vanilla 3.4+.

Martin will give a quick overview and Kaushik and Adithya will provide
more detail on specific improvements. We'll also cover planned future
work in this area.
