# Overview of Gerrit in AWS

Here at GerritForge we are doubling down
the [efforts to bring Gerrit to the cloud]( https://gitenterprise.me/2021/01/04/2021-whats-cooking-in-gerritforge/)
. As part of this endeavour, we have been working on the AWS-Gerrit project,
which strives to provide a framework to seamlessly deploy and maintain gerrit
installations in AWS.

This talk will give an overview of what AWS gerrit actually is, motivate its
usage and provide an overview of its current status. In the second part, we will
showcase and live demo some of AWS-Gerrit main features.
