# Submit Requirements: Waving goodbye to Prolog

Over the last year, Google has worked on a new way to define what makes
a change submittable. Gerrit offers great flexibility for that by
allowing users to write Prolog code. Prolog, however, is complex
to learn. The new system offers simpler configuration that is just
as flexible.

In this talk, I'll demo the new submit requirements and talk about
how you can wave goodbye to Prolog, too.
