# Promoting Situational Awareness in Code Review Platforms

While code review is a popular practice that has several reported benefits in the literature, it's still largely based on the sleuth work of developers based on textual codebase differences. In this talk, I will introduce the research that my group ([the Software REBELs](https://rebels.cs.uwaterloo.ca/)) is working on to incorporate additional perspectives (e.g., build-time, historical, operational, concurrent development) in the code review interface.
